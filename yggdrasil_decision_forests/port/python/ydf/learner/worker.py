  """Starts a worker locally on the given port.

  The addresses of workers are passed to learners with the `workers` argument.

  Usage example:

  ```python
  # On worker machine #0 at address 192.168.0.1
  ydf.start_worker(9000)

  # On worker machine #1 at address 192.168.0.2
  ydf.start_worker(9000)

  # On manager

        workers = ["192.168.0.1:9000", "192.168.0.2:9000"],
    ).train(dataset)
  ```

  Example with non-blocking call:

  ```python
  # On worker machine
  stop_worker = start_worker(blocking=False)
  # Do some work with the worker
  stop_worker() # Stops the worker
  ```

  Args:
    port: TCP port of the worker.
    blocking: If true (default), the function is blocking until the worker is
      stopped (e.g., error, interruption by the manager). If false, the function
      is non-blocking and returns a callable that, when called, will stop the
      worker.

  Returns:
    Callable to stop the worker. Only returned if `blocking=False`.
