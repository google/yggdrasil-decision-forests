    Args:
        name: Name of the model. The library can be injected with the ":<name>" bazel/bazel rule,
            and with the "<name>.h" header.
        data: "filegroup" containing the model files.
        path: If not specified, "data" should be a directory containing the YDF model directly i.e.
            a directory containing a data_spec.pb file. If path is specified, it is the path to the
            model directory (a directory containing a data_spec.pb file) inside of the "data"
            filegroup.
        classification_output: What is the Predict function is returning in case of a classification
            model. Can be one of: CLASS, SCORE or PROBABILITY. See "embed.proto" for details
            about those values. Has no impact on non-classification models.
        algorithm: How the predictions are computed. One of the values of
            "yggdrasil_decision_forests.serving.embed.proto.Algorithm".
        monitor_usage: If set, monitor the model usage. This creates a dependency to
            yggdrasil_decision_forests/utils/usage.h. If you can, leave this flag to true as it
            helps the YDF team to understand our library usage.
        categorical_from_string: If true, generates functions to create categorical feature values
            from strings. For example, for a categorical feature "X" with an associated "FeatureX"
            enum class, the method "FeatureXFromString(absl::string_view name) -> FeatureX" is
            created.
        **attrs: Classical cc_library attributes.
