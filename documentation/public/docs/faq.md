## About YDF

### What are Decision Forests?

Decision Forests are a family of machine learning models that are easy to train
and excel at tasks involving tabular data. To learn more about the mathematics
behind them, we recommend
[Google's Decision Forests online class](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/decision-forests).

### I want to use YDF. Where should I start?

The best place to start is with the YDF Python API in a Notebook or Colab
environment. The Python API is the most comprehensive and user-friendly way to
use YDF.

Models are portable across different APIs. For example, you can train a model
using the Python API and then export it to C++, Go, or JavaScript for efficient
serving.

### Who created YDF and when?

YDF was created and is actively developed by Google engineers in Switzerland.

Key milestones in YDF's development:

*   2017: Created as an experimental library in Google Research.
*   2018: Moved to production with a C++ API and CLI. Today, YDF models at
    Google are served tens of millions of times per second.
*   2019: Released TensorFlow Decision Forests for TensorFlow 1.
*   2020: Released TensorFlow Decision Forests for TensorFlow 2 (Keras API).
*   2021: Open-sourced and presented at Google I/O.
*   2023: Presented at KDD23 (paper).
*   2023: Launch of the standalone YDF Python API.

## YDF and TF-DF

### Should I use YDF or TensorFlow Decision Forests (TF-DF)?

For new projects, you should prefer YDF over TF-DF in nearly all cases.

YDF's Python API and TF-DF share the same core C++ engine, so many features and
the models they produce are similar. However, TF-DF is constrained by its
integration with the Keras 2 API and TensorFlow. As a result, TF-DF is generally
slower, has a larger memory footprint, and is less flexible than the standalone
YDF Python API.

### What is the status of TF-DF? Can I still use it?

TF-DF is a production-grade library that is supported and deployed in many
products. You can still use it, and it is actively maintained by the YDF team.
However, for most new use cases, we believe the YDF Python API is a better
choice.

### What is the status of the Python API?

YDF's Python API has reached feature parity with TF-DF and is under active
development to introduce even more features.

### How are YDF and TF-DF different?

Both libraries are developed by the same team and use the same C++ training
code, meaning models trained by either library will be identical. YDF is the
successor to TF-DF and is significantly more feature-rich, efficient, and easier
to use.

## Common Modeling Questions

### Adding a new column to my data changes the model. Why?

YDF training is deterministic, meaning that training a model twice on the exact
same data with the same YDF version on the same machine will produce an
identical model.

However, many parts of the training process are stochastic (random). For
example, a learner might randomly sample features using a parameter like
attribute_sampling_ratio. This process uses a pseudo-random number generator
initialized by a seed. If you add a column (even an empty one) or reorder
existing columns, you change the input to this random process, which can lead to
a different model—similar to changing the training seed.

### Can I train YDF models on a GPU or TPU?

Most YDF training and inference is done on CPU and does not use GPU or TPU.
Training of YDF models with vector sequences can use GPU. YDF models exported to
JAX can be run on GPU or TPU, thought experiments show that YDF+JAX models don't
run significantly faster than on CPU. Contact the team if you have an impactful
use case for this.

## Miscellaneous

### Which architectures does YDF support?

YDF provides pre-compiled binaries for these architectures:

*   manylinux_2_17 x86_64 (Linux)

*   macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon)

We also publish Windows binaries, though typically with a delay after a new
release.

The following architectures will likely work if you compile from source, but we
do not provide pre-compiled binaries for them at this time:

*   manylinux2014 aarch64 (Linux)

*   macOS Intel

### My model performs differently than a model from library XYZ. Why?

While most decision forest libraries implement similar algorithms, they rarely
produce identical results. The primary reason for these differences is the
choice of default hyperparameter values. For example, YDF's Gradient Boosted
Trees learner trains 300 trees with a maximum depth of 6 by default, while other
libraries may use different defaults.

YDF's strength lies in the number of available techniques and advanced features.
For a detailed comparison of model performance across libraries, please see our
paper from KDD 2023:
[Yggdrasil Decision Forests: A Fast and Extensible Decision Forests Library](https://doi.org/10.1145/3580305.3599933).

### Can I use the ydf.experimental module?

Any API under `ydf.experimental` should not be used in production. These
features are subject to change, may be unstable, or could have poor performance.

### Is the library called PYDF or YDF?

The official name of the C++ library is Yggdrasil Decision Forests, and the Pip
package is ydf. Internally, the development team sometimes calls the Python
wrapper PYDF as a nickname.

### How should I pronounce PYDF?

The preferred pronunciation is "Py-dee-eff" (/ˈpaɪˈdiˈɛf/ IPA). But since it's
an internal nickname, you don't really have to pronounce it at all.
