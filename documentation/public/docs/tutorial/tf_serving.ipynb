    "## About this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to train a YDF model, export it to the TensorFlow SavedModel format, and run this model in Vertex AI.\n",
    "Additionally, the tutorial shows how to manually run the TensorFlow Serving binary to make inferences with the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is TF Serving?\n",
    "\n",
    "[TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving) is a production environment for running machine learning models. TensorFlow Serving can run YDF models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Vertex AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs) is a Google Cloud solution to manage and serve ML models. Vertex AI relies on [TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving) to run TensorFlow models (stored in the [TensorFlow SavedModel](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model) format). YDF models can be exported to TensorFlow SavedModel and run on TensorFlow Serving and Vertex AI with the [model.to_tensorflow_saved_model](../../py_api/GradientBoostedTreesModel/#ydf.GradientBoostedTreesModel.to_tensorflow_saved_model) method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important remark about TensorFlow Saved Model inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow Saved Model can be seen as a generic function that takes data as input and produces predictions as output. TensorFlow Serving and Vertex AI define three input formats for feeding input features and three output formats for retrieving predictions. Using the incorrect format can results in cryptic error messages. Understanding these formats is not necessary for using TensorFlow Serving and Vertex AI, but it can be helpful for debugging your pipeline. This section provides an overview of the formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "YDF allows you to select the type of format of your model using the `servo_api: bool` and `feed_example_proto: bool` argument of the `to_tensorflow_saved_model` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input format #1: input instances**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this format, the data is grouped by examples, where each example is a dictionary of features in a list. The format is straightforward but not very efficient. This format is easily usable with all APIs (REST, Python, C++). **This format is used by Vertex AI for Online predictions and by Vertex AI Batch predictions on jsonl**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an a list of examples, each having 3 features \"f1\", \"f2\", and \"f3\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "[ {\"f1\": 1, \"f2\": 5.9, \"f3\": \"red\" }, {\"f1\": 3, \"f2\": 2.1, \"f3\": \"blue\" } ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the default input format of the `to_tensorflow_saved_model` function i.e. `feed_example_proto=False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input format #2: input feature**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this format, the data is grouped by features, where each feature is a list of values in a dictionary. The format is relatively straightforward and the most efficient. This format is easily usable with all APIs (REST, Python, C++). When possible, this is the format to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the same example in this format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"f1\": [1, 3], \"f2\": [5.9, 2.1], \"f3\": [\"red\", \"blue\"] }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also the default input format of the `to_tensorflow_saved_model` function i.e. `feed_example_proto=False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input format #3: serialized tensorflow examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this last format, the data is encoded as a [Google Protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) of [TensorFlow Example protos](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/Example), which is also the format used to train large TensorFlow pipelines.\n",
    "This format is not efficient for serving and relatively complex to use. When possible, try to avoid using it for inference. **This format is required by Vertex AI Batch predictions on TensorFlow Records files**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This format is enabled with `feed_example_proto=True` in the `to_tensorflow_saved_model` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output format #1: predict**\n",
    "\n",
    "This format is the simplest and most efficient one. The predicted value is directly outputted by the model. The meaning of the predictions is determined by the model. A classification model, for instance, will output probabilities, whereas a regression model will output values. This is the default output format of the `to_tensorflow_saved_model` function i.e. `servo_api=False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of prediction for a binary classification model:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{ \"prediction\": [0.2, 0.7] }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of prediction for a multi-class classification model:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{ \"prediction\": [[0.2, 0.1, 0.7],\n",
    "                  [0.8, 0.1, 0.1]] }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This format is available for Vertex AI Online predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output format #2 & 3: classify and regress**\n",
    "\n",
    "In those formats, the model outputs a dictionary of values. The values depend on the model type. For instance, a classification model will output a \"score\" and a \"labels\" value. This output format is enabled with `servo_api=True` in the `to_tensorflow_saved_model` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This format is available for Vertex AI Online predictions, and required for Vertex AI Batch predictions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of prediction for a binary-classification model:\n",
    "\n",
