        "\n",
        "In gradient boosted trees, the loss is a function that takes a label value and a prediction, and returns the \"amount of error\" of this prediction. The model is trained to minimize the average loss over all the training examples. YDF implements various common losses. You can configure them with the \"loss\" parameter. You can see the list of available losses [here](https://ydf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hyperparameters/#loss). If you don't specify the loss, it is selected automatically according to the model task. For instance, if the task is regression, the loss is set to mean-squared error by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "If YDF does not support a loss you needs, you can define it manually. This is called a \"custom loss\".\n",
        "\n",
        "In this introduction tutorial, we will create a custom **Regression Loss** called **Mean Squared Logarithmic Error**.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Custom Losses in YDF\n",
        "\n",
        "In YDF, a custom loss consists of four parts:\n",
        "*   **Initial prediction**: The initial prediction of the model, e.g. the average of the labels.\n",
        "*   **Gradient and Hessian**: A function that computes the gradient and the diagonal of the hessian of the loss given the label and the prediction of the model before the activation function (a.k.a. linkage function).\n",
        "*   **Loss**: A function that measures the quality of the current solution. While theory might dictate that the gradient and hessian are actually the gradient and hessian of the loss function, approximations do very well in practice.\n",
        "*   **Activation**: A function applied to the predictions to transform them to the correct space (e.g. probabilities for classification problems)"

        "*   When using custom losses, YDF may trigger the GC to catch illegal memory accesses. Set `may_trigger_gc=False` on the loss object to avoid this, but be aware that YDF may not warn about illegal memory accesses then.\n",
        "*   The arrays returned by the custom loss functions may be modified by YDF.\n",
        "*   Training with custom losses is often ~10% slower than training built-in losses.\n",
        "*   Custom losses are not fully supported for model inspection and analysis - it is not yet possible to compute the model's custom loss on a test set in YDF."
