        "JAX is a machine learning library to train neural network models. While decision forests trained by YDF are different from neural networks, YDF and JAX can be combined to create powerful hybrid models.\n",

        "Second, we show how YDF and JAX can be combined to solve the distribution shift problem: We train a YDF model, convert it to a JAX model, finetune it using JAX, and convert it back to a YDF model."

As an example, distribution shift occurs in hospitals when training a model on data acquired by different devices. Although datasets from different devices should be compatible, subtle differences between them cause a model trained on one dataset to perform poorly on another. For instance, a machine learning model trained to detect tumors on images captured by a device might not work effectively on images captured by a device from another brand. Distribution shifts are also common in dynamic systems that change overtime (e.g., user behaviors).\n",
