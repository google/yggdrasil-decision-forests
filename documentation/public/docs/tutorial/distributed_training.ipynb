    "## What is distributed training?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distributed training** is a technique that involves splitting the computation cost of training a model over multiple computers. In other words, instead of training a model on a single machine, the model is trained on multiple machines in parallel. This can significantly speed up the training process, as well as allow for larger datasets to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed training has been used to train YDF models on datasets containing **billions of examples** and **thousands of features**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed training can also be used for hyperparameter tuning: While each model is trained on a single machine, multiple models can be trained and evaluated in parallel, which can speed up the process of finding the best hyperparameters. \n",
    "See the [tuning](../tuning) notebook for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed training requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A collection of machines called **workers** that can communicate with each other via IP. In this notebook, we will spawn workers locally for the sake of example.\n",
    "- A **manager** machine that will execute the YDF code and can communicate with the workers via their IP addresses.\n",
    "- A **shared directory** that is accessible by both the manager and worker machines. This directory will be used as a computation cache and for checkpoints in case one of the workers or the manager is interrupted during training.\n",
    "- A dataset on disk in one of the supported YDF formats, such as csv or tfrecord. Furthermore, the dataset must be sharded, which means it must be divided into subfiles so that each worker can handle a different portion of the dataset in parallel. In this example, we will use a small dataset and split it up ahead of time. For large datasets, sharding should be done beforehand, for example using Apache Beam."
