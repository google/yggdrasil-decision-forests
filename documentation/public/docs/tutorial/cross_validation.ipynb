    "[Cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) is a method for estimating the quality of a model. It serves the same purpose as the **train and test protocol**, but cross-validation is more accurate.\n",

    "**Note:** Cross-validation only requires a single dataset. If you have a training and testing dataset sampled from the same distribution, it is best to merge both datasets and to apply cross-validation on the result."
